The vast majority of research on homotypic vacuole fusion has been performed using _S. cerevisiae_ models. However, the process of homotypic vacuole fusion is vital for the functioning of a wide array of organisms including _A. thaliana_ in which vacuole fusion controls stomatal movement. While homotypic vacuole fusion is known to be a highly conserved process, recent studies point to a non-conserved mechanism driving _A. thaliana_ homotypic vacuole fusion. Therefore, in an attempt to elucidate the similarities and differences between _S. cerevisiae_ and _A. thaliana_ homotypic vacuole fusion, I constructed PPI graph representations of homotypic vacuole fusion in each organism. I then compared these graphs to determine which PPIs were conserved between the two organisms. I also performed graph based importance analysis to determine high importance proteins in each organism. By comparing both conserved PPIs and high importance proteins, I was able to determine that the process of homotypic vacuole fusion in _S. cerevisiae_ differs significantly from _A. thaliana_. My analysis points to phosphoinositide regulation as a major difference between the two processes with _A. thaliana_ displaying a much more complex system of phosphoinositide synthesis and modification.
