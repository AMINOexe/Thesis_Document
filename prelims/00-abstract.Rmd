The vast majority of research on homotypic vacuole fusion has been performed using _S. cerevisiae_ models. However, the process of homotypic vacuole fusion is vital for the functioning of a wide array of organisms including _A. thaliana_ in which vacuole fusion controls stomatal movement. Stomata are small mouth shaped pores present on the leaves and stems of most terrestrial plants which control gas exchange. Two guard cells, each containing multiple vacuoles, surround the stomatal pore. To open the stomatal pore, vacuoles inside the guard cells fuse together forming a single large vacuole. To close the stomata, the vacuoles fragment, deflating the guard cells which covers the stomatal aperture. While homotypic vacuole fusion is known to be a highly conserved process, recent studies point to a non-conserved mechanism driving _A. thaliana_ homotypic vacuole fusion. Therefore, in an attempt to elucidate the similarities and differences between _S. cerevisiae_ and _A. thaliana_ homotypic vacuole fusion, I constructed protein-protien interaction (PPI) graph representations of homotypic vacuole fusion in each organism. I then compared these graphs to determine which PPIs were conserved between the two organisms. I also performed graph based importance analysis to determine high importance proteins in each organism. By comparing both conserved PPIs and high importance proteins, I was able to determine that the process of homotypic vacuole fusion in _S. cerevisiae_ differs significantly from _A. thaliana_. My analysis points to phosphoinositide regulation as a major difference between the two processes with _A. thaliana_ displaying a much more complex system of phosphoinositide synthesis and modification.
