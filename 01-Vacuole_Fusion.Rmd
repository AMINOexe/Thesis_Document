# Background {.unnumbered}

| Vacuoles are intracellular compartments enclosed by a membrane which separates its internal contents from the cytoplasm of its enclosing cell. At a cursory glance, vacuoles may seem to be relatively simple organelles, storing water, nutrients, and waste products while lacking intra-organelle machinery in comparison to many of the more ‘glamorous’ organelles. However, despite their simplicity, vacuoles play crucial roles in various cellular processes across all eukaryotes. These functions include, but are not limited to, waste disposal, maintaining internal cell pressure, structural support, storage for nutrients, ions, pigments, and water, endocytosis, exocytosis, osmoregulation, autophagy, and defense against pathogens. 
|     One such role of vacuoles is the regulation of stomatal opening and closing in the vast majority of terrestrial plants. The intake of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gasses is essential for photosynthesis in all plants. However, to absorb atmospheric gasses plants must expose their internal structures to the environment which causes water stored within the plant to evaporate. Therefore, plants must carefully balance their CO2 absorption with water availability. Stomata are small mouth shaped pores present on the epidermis of nearly all land plants and are responsible for regulating gas exchange. The term stomata refers to a two part structure consisting of the stomatal aperture and two guard cells which surround the stomatal aperture creating a mouth like appearance. In the stomata’s open state, both guard cells are deflated and the stomatal aperture is exposed allowing for the free exchange of atmospheric gasses and water between the plant and its environment. In the stomata’s closed state, the guard cells inflate, covering the stomatal aperture and preventing gasses from entering or leaving the plant. In the deflated state, guard cells contain many small vacuoles filled primarily with water. In the inflated state, the vacuoles within guard cells fuse together to form much larger vacuoles, causing the guard cells to swell and cover the stomatal aperture. The fusion of two identical vacuole is known as homotypic vacuole fusion. This process differs from heterotypic vacuole fusion (fusion between vacuoles with different morphology) which is usually implicated in the transportation of molecules throughout an organism.
|     In contrast to their simplistic internal structure, the process of vacuole fusion is remarkably complex. Consequently, researchers have turned to the study of model organisms in an attempt to better understand the components and signaling mechanisms involved in vacuole fusion. _S. cerevisiae_, also known as brewers yeast, has proven to be an ideal candidate for studying vacuole fusion (specifically homotypic vacuole fusion) due to its extensively studied genome, easy to visualize vacuoles, and our ability to isolate, purify, and store its vacuoles in high quantities. Furthermore, nearly 50 years of extensive research has been devoted to the study of yeast vacuole fusion providing researchers with a strong foundation of research to draw from. 
|     In this thesis, I compare the processes of homotypic vacuole fusion in _S. cerevisiae_ and _A. thaliana_ to determine which elements of the two processes are conserved. The idea for this thesis came about during my reasearch of _A. thaliana_ guard cell vacuole fusion. I noticed that, in comparison to _S. cerevisiae_, _A. thaliana_ vacuole fusion was relatively understudied. However, many papers describe homotypic vacuole fusion as a highly conserved process. Therefore, I decided to compare the processes of homotypic vacuole fusion in the two organisms, identifying homologous proteins and interactions existing in both processes. The first chapter contains background information detailing the process of homotypic vacuole fusion in _S. cerevisiae_. The second chapter details the computational methods used to analyze the homologous interactions between each organism. The final chapter discusses the similarities and differences between each organisms homotypic vacuole fusion process. 


##  _S. cerevisiae_ Vacuole Fusion Components {.unnumbered}
  * SNARE Complex
    * SNARE proteins have two separate classification systems based on functionality and structural features respectively. Functional classification splits SNAREs into two groups: v-SNAREs which are localized to the vesicle, and t-SNAREs which are localized to the target membrane. Likewise, structural classification also splits SNAREs into two groups: Q-SNAREs which contain the central amino acid residue glutamine, and R-SNAREs which contain the central amino acid residue arginine (Yoon & Munson, 2018 and Ungermann et al. 1998). While it is true that R-SNAREs are often also v-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs are often also t-SNAREs, this is not always the case (Hong, 2005). There are four distinct SNARE proteins present on the yeast vacuole membrane, three Q-SNAREs: Qa (Vam3), Qb (Vti1), Qc (Vam7), and one R-SNARE: R (Nyv1). In their inactive state, the four SNARE proteins form tightly bound bundles known as cis-SNARE complexes along the vacuole membrane (Zick & Wickner, 2016).
  * Vps1
    * Vps1 is responsible for sequestering individual Qa SNAREs, preventing them from forming stable cis-SNARE complexes along with the R SNARE and the other two Q SNAREs. It is thought that Vps1 polymerizes around the Qa SNARE domain, sequestering a population of Qa SNAREs which are able to undergo HOPS tethering but are unable to bind to other SNARE proteins. Vps1 must then be released prior to trans-SNARE assembly in a process involving Sec18 GTP hydrolysis independent from Sec17 (Alpadi et al. 2013; Peters et al. 2004; Rothlisberger et al., 2009).
  * LMA1
    * While Sec18 is bound to the cis-SNARE complex, LMA1 is bound to Sec18. Upon Sec18 mediated ATP hydrolysis, LMA1 is released from Sec18 and is bound to the Qa SNARE, stabilizing the protein (Xu et al., 1998, 1997).
  * Sec17
    * Sec17 is responsible for the recruitment of Sec18 to cis-SNARE complexes. It functions as an intermediary by binding to both Sec18 and the cis-SNARE complex (Collins et al., 2005; Haas & Wickner, 1996; Mayer et al., 1996; Song et al., 2017, 2021; Song & Wickner, 2021; Zick et al., 2015).
  * Sec18
    * Sec18 is responsible for ATP hydrolysis leading to the disassembly of the cis-SNARE complex and the transfer of LMA1 to the Qa SNARE. (Collins et al., 2005; Haas & Wickner, 1996; Mayer et al., 1996; Song et al., 2017, 2021; Song & Wickner, 2021; Zick et al., 2015)
  * Phosphoinositides
    * The primary role of phosphoinositides during the priming stage is the release of monomeric Sec18 from the vacuole membrane. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is responsible for binding and sequestering Sec18 along the vacuole membrane. The release of Sec18 from the membrane is catalyzed by the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Pah1p which converts PA to diacylglycerol (DAG). Once released from the membrane the Sec18 monomers assemble into the Sec18 hexamer which is the active form responsible for cis-SNARE disassembly (Boeddinghaus et al., 2002; Cheever et al., 2001; Fratti et al., 2004; Karunakaran et al., 2012; Kato & Wickner, 2001; Miner et al., 2018, 2019; Orr & Wickner, 2023; Starr & Fratti, 2019; Zhang et al., 2022, 2025).
  * Pah1
    * A phosphatidic acid phosphatase responsible for the conversion of PA to DAG (Sasser et al., 2012).
  * Ypt7 
    * A Ras-like GTPase which, in conjunction with the HOPS complex, acts as a tether holding the two opposing membranes in close proximity. Ypt7 is present in both its GTP and GDP forms along the vacuole membrane. While Ypt7 is able to associate with the non-phosphorylated HOPS complex in both its GTP and GDP forms, it can only associate with the phosphorylated HOPS complex in its GTP form (Hickey et al., 2009; Price et al., 2000; Zick & Wickner, 2016). 
  * HOPS Complex
    * A hexameric protein complex consisting of Vps39,Vps41,Vps33, Vps11, Vps16, and Vps18. The HOPS complex plays two main roles in yeast homotypic vacuole fusion: Vacuole tethering via Ypt7 binding, and organization of SNARE proteins (Auffarth et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2015; Brillada et al., 2018; Bröcker et al., 2012; Ho & Stroupe, n.d.; Krämer & Ungermann, 2011; Price et al., 2000; Seals et al., 2000; Shvarev et al., 2022b, 2022a; Song et al., 2020; Starai et al., 2008; Stroupe et al., 2006). 
  * Ccz1–Mon1 Complex
    * A protein complex responsible for the conversion of Ypt7-GDP to Ypt7-GTP. Mon1 is released from the vacuole in an ATP-dependant fashion at which point it dimerizes with Ccz1 throug a currently uncharacterized mechanism (Eitzen et al., 2001; Irazoqui et al., 2003; Müller et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2003).
  * PI3P
    * A regulatory lipid which recruits the Ccz1–Mon1 Complex to Ypt7 in its GDP form. PI3P is also responsible for binding the Qc SNARE Vam7 to the membrane and recruiting the HOPS complex. (Starr et al., 2019, Cabrera et al., 2014;)
  * Vps34/Vps15 Complex
    * Vps34 is a PI3 kinase responsible for the conversion of membrane bound Phosphatidylinositol (PI) to PI3P. It forms complexes with Vps15 which acts as a membrane anchor. Once bound to the membrane, Vps34 is activated by its effector protein Gpa1 and converts PI into PI3P (Heenan et al., 2009; Slessareva et al., 2006; Stack et al., 1993).
  * Vam7
    * Origially part of the cis-SNARE complex, Vam7 is expelled into the cytosol following cis-SNARE dissassembly. Vam7 is then recruited to the vacuole membrane by PI3P and is partially responsible for HOPS complex tethering (Zick & Wickner, 2013).
  * V-ATPase Complex
    * A 13 member protein complex split into two sectors. The V0 sector is comprised of VPH1, VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, and VMA6. The V1 sector is comprised of VMA1, VMA2, VMA4, VMA5, VMA7, VMA8, VMA10, AND VMA13. While the V-ATPase complex is commonly implicated in the active transport of protons across the vacuolar membrane, evidence points to a separate role of the V-ATPase complex in homotypic vacuole fusion. Analysis of V-ATPase activity during vacuole fusion has shown that the V0 sectors of V-ATPase complexes on the opposing membranes form inter-membrane V0 complexes. It has been proposed that these inter-membrane V0 complexes act as the initial fusion pores during the process of vertex ring hemifusion (Baars et al., 2007; Coonrod et al., 2013; Desfougères et al., 2016; Graham et al., 2003).
  * Cadmodulin
    * A regulatory protein which responds to Ca+ concentration and is bound to the membrane in a Ca+ dependant fashion. Cadmodulin binds to the V0 sector of the V-ATPase complex and, in response to Ca+, induces the formation of a V0 protein pore (Peters et al., 2001; Bayer et al., 2003). 
  * VTC Complex
    * A 4 member protein complex comprised of VTC1, VTC2, VTC3, and VTC4. Co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that the VTC complex binds to the VPH1 protein present in the V0 sector of V-ATPase. This binding activity is theorized to induce conformational changes in the V0 sector and induce the opening of the fusion pore (Müller et al., 2002, 2003).

## _S. cerevisiae_ Vacuole Fusion Stages {.unnumbered}
The process of homotypic vacuole fusion in _S. cerevisiae_ is commonly divided into four general stages: Priming, Tethering, Docking, and Fusion. During the priming stage, cellular machinery is prepared for the vacuole fusion process. Tethering involves binding the two vacuole membranes together using sets of linkage proteins. Docking finalizes the positioning of the linking proteins, brinking the two vacuole membranes into close proximity. Finally, fusion involves the zippering the two vacuole membranes together, forming the final fused vacuole. 

### Priming {.unnumbered}
|     It is important to note that the protein complexes present on the vacuole membrane prior to fusion are often the result of prior fusion reactions. For example, the cis-SNARE complex is assembled during the final step of the fusion process and remains bound in its cis conformation until the next fusion event (Ungermann et al., 1998). Likewise Sec17 is bound to the cis-SNARE complex in the same fashion (Collins et al., 2005). Prior to the initation of priming, Sec18 is bound to the membrane by Phosphatidic acid (PA) and acts as a membrane receptor for the protein LMA1 (Starr et al., 2019; Xu et al., 1998). To initiate priming, PA is converted to Diacylglycerol (DAG) by the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Pah1 (Sasser et al., 2012). This conversion releases monomeric Sec18 from the membrane. The Sec18 monomers then assemble into hexameric complexes and are recruited to cis-SNARE complexes by Sec17 (Starr et al., 2019; Delgado Cruz & Kim, 2019). Sec18 binds to Sec17 and hydrolyzes ATP, facilitating the disassembly of the cis-SNARE complex into individual SNARE proteins (Song et al., 2017). During this reaction, LMA1 dissociates from Sec18 and binds to the Qa SNARE (Vam3), providing stabilization (Xu et al., 1997). While three of the four SNARE proteins are membrane-anchored, the Qc SNARE (Vam7) is bound only to the other SNARE proteins within the cis-SNARE complex. Upon Sec18 mediated disassembly, the Qc SNARE and Sec17 are released into the cytosol (Collins et al., 2005). There is also evidence that bundles of Qa SNAREs exist along the membrane during the priming process. These Qa SNARE groups are sequestered by polymerized Vps1 proteins which prevent Qa snares from associating with other SNARE proteins (Alpadi et al., 2013; Röthlisberger et al., 2009). Additionally, several phosphoinositides such as Ergesterol and PI(4,5)P2 have been implicated in the priming stage of homotypic vacuole fusion although their functions have yet to be defined (Kato & Wickner, 2001).

### Tethering & Docking {.unnumbered}
|     In the initial stage of the tethering process, both Vps41 (a HOPS complex subunit) and Ypt7 must be phosphorylated by Yck3 and the Ccz1-Mon1 complex respectively (Zick & Wickner, 2012; Wang et al., 2003). During this step, Vps34 is recruited to the membrane by the membrane bound Vps15. This Vps34/15 complex is then activated by Gpa1 to synthesize PI3P from PI (Stack et al., 1993). Following these phosphorylation events, the HOPS complex binds to Ypt7 proteins on the two opposing membranes tethering the two vesicles in close proximity (Price et al., 2000). The HOPS complex shares a binding affinity for both Vam7 and PI3P which promotes the localization of both components along the vertex ring at which point HOPS-Vam7 binding initiates trans-SNARE assembly (Stroupe et al., 2006). It is important to note that this process not only tethers the two membranes together but also correctly positions the SNARE proteins on the opposing membranes as antiparallel bound SNAREs often lead to fusion inactive complexes (Song & Wickner, 2019). In addition to the numerous regulatory mechanisms above, tethering is also mediated by the dynamin-like Vps1 protein. Vps1 sequesters a population of individual Qa SNARE proteins which remain separate from cis-SNARE complexes. Qa SNARE bundles associated with Vps1 can undergo tethering upon contact with the HOPS complex; however, to form trans-SNARE complexes, Vps1 must be depolymerized by Sec18 to release the individual Qa-SNAREs (Alpadi et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2004; Röthlisberger et al., 2009). 
|     While tethering and docking are generally defined as separate processes in yeast homotypic vacuole fusion, the distinction between when tethering ends and docking begins is not clearly delinated. Docking is said to be completed once trans-SNARE complexes have been established, bridging the two opposing membranes. This process is primarily mediated by the HOPS complex (Ho & Stroupe, 2016). During the docking process, the HOPS complex protects trans SNARE complexes from Sec18 mediated dissassembly, initiates trans SNARE complex assembly by binding to the Qa SNARE and R SNARE on opposing membranes, proofreads SNARE complexes allowing only correctly assembled SNARES to undergo trans-complex formation, and recruits the remaining Q-SNAREs to its binding site to complete trans SNARE complex assembly (Song et al., 2020; Starai et al., 2008; Zick & Wickner, 2013; Collins et al., 2005). While it has been shown that Qa and R SNARE HOPS association precedes the recruitment of the remaining Q-SNAREs, the mechanism behind the recruitment of the remaining Q-SNAREs and the order of their assembly is currently unknown (Shvarev et al., 2022).

### Fusion {.unnumbered}
The final fusion event is perhaps the least understood stage of _S. cerevisiae_ vacuole fusion. Although a number of components have been linked to the final fusion process through genetic deletion screens and co-immunoprecipitation, the mechanisms by which many components regulate the fusion event have yet to be revealed (Bayer et al., 2003; Müller et al., 2002; Peters et al., 2001). The final fusion event begins once trans-SNARE complexes have been established between two vacuoles (Jun & Wickner, 2007). The assembly of trans-SNARE complexes induces the formation of the vertex ring, a region in which the two vacuole membranes are pressed tightly together forming a flattened boundary (Wickner, 2010). Bilayer and Lumenal Content Mixing is thought to occur via vertex ring hemifusion. Whereas the classical model of hemifusion involves the zippering of membranes proceeding outward from a single fusion pore, the vertex ring hemifusion model proceeds via two separate fusion pores resulting in a fused vacuole containing smaller intralumenal membrane vesicles (Wang et al., 2002). These intralumenal membrane vesicles can be observed in _S. cerevisiae_ post fusion which provides strong evidence for the vertex ring hemifusion model as the classical model of hemifusion cannot account for the formation of such vesicles. The activity of the V-ATP complex is one of the several proposed mechanisms by which hemifusion occurs. In response to luminal acidification, the V1 subunit is released from the membrane bound V0 subunit. Concomitantly, in response to Ca+ efflux triggered by trans-SNARE formation, cadmodulin binds to and triggers conformational change in the V0 subunit. The VTC complex is thought to bind to, and stabilize these primed V0 subunits. Following priming, two V0 subunits on the opposing membranes form trans-V0 complexes which are thought to act as fusion pores (Müller et al., 2002; Peters et al., 2001). Although the role of the V-ATPase complex in vacuole fusion is largely attributed to its formation of fusion pores, it is important to note that the complex is also involved in vacuole luminal acidification. Luminal acidification has been shown to negatively regulate vacuole fusion and recent studies have shown that decoupling of the V1 and V0 V-ATPase subunits occurs only in vescicles with sufficiently acidified vacuoles (Desfougères et al., 2016; Poëa-Guyon et al., 2013).

## _A. thaliana_ Guard Cell Homotypic Vacuole Fusion {.unnumbered}
|     While _S. cerevisiae_ homotypic vacuole fusion has been extensively studied, the process is not well characterized in _A. thaliana_ or other plant models. It is known that homotypic vacuole fusion is highly conserved among eukaryotes (Wickner & Schekman, 2008). However, recent studies have shown that _A. thaliana_ guard cell vacuole fusion may occur through an unknown mechanism, unlike those observed in _S. cerevisiae_ homotypic vacuole fusion. In both _A. thaliana_ and _S. cerevisiae_, the phosphoinositide PI3P is required for the recruitment of the HOPS complex to the vacuole membrane. However, chemical depletion of PI3P in _A. thaliana_ has been shown to induce rapid guard cell vacuole fusion while the same treatment applied to _S. cerevisiae_ significantly inhibited vacuole fusion (Hodgens et al., 2024). Depletion of PI3P is acheived by incubating _A. thaliana_ leaves in a buffer solution containing the fugal metabolite wortmannin, which targets PI3K and PI4K in a dose dependant manner, for two hours in the dark (Takáč et al., 2012). PI3K is the kinase responsible for the production of PI3P and its inhibition leads to PI3P depletion in wortmannin treated leaves (Lee et al., 2008; Hodgens et al., 2024). The mechanism underlying the disparity between _S. cerevisiae_ and _A. thaliana_ PI3P function is still being investigated with current research pointing to phosphoproteomic regulation as a possible factor.
|     Despite the relatively understudied nature of _A. thaliana_ homotypic vacuole fusion, and the observed disparities between _A. thaliana_ and _S. cerevisiae_ vacuole fusion processes, there are a number of conserved elements which have been confirmed to perform similar roles in each organism. One such element is the HOPS complex, a hexamer composed of 6 homologous proteins (VPS 11,16,18,33,39, and 41) (Pullen et al., 2025). Additionally, the YPT7 homolog in _A. thaliana_, RABG3f, has been shown to be mediated by the MON1-CCZ1 complex and, in turn, mediates downstream HOPS complex interactions (Cui et al., 2014).
