Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of 
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence them (add # before each line). 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

version automatically by inputting them in the YAML at the top of this file.
Alternatively, you can put that content in files like 00--prelim.Rmd and
00-abstract.Rmd like done below.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

| At a cursory glance, vacuoles may seem to be relatively simple organelles, storing water, nutrients, and waste products while lacking intra-organelle machinery in comparison to many of the more ‘glamorous’ organelles. However, despite their simplicity, vacuoles play crucial roles in various cellular processes across all eukaryotes. These functions include, but are not limited to, waste disposal, maintaining internal cell pressure, structural support, storage for nutrients, ions, pigments, and water, endocytosis, exocytosis, osmoregulation, autophagy, and defense against pathogens. 
|     One such role of vacuoles is the regulation of stomatal opening and closing in the vast majority of terrestrial plants. The intake of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gasses is essential for photosynthesis in all plants. However, to absorb atmospheric gasses plants must expose their internal structures to the environment which causes water stored within the plant to evaporate. Therefore, plants must carefully balance their CO2 absorption with water availability. Stomata are small mouth shaped pores present on the epidermis of nearly all land plants and are responsible for regulating gas exchange. The term stomata refers to a two part structure consisting of the stomatal aperture and two guard cells which surround the stomatal aperture creating a mouth like appearance. In the stomata’s open state, both guard cells are deflated and the stomatal aperture is exposed allowing for the free exchange of atmospheric gasses and water between the plant and its environment. In the stomata’s closed state, the guard cells inflate, covering the stomatal aperture and preventing gasses from entering or leaving the plant. In the deflated state, guard cells contain many small vacuoles filled primarily with water. In the inflated state, the vacuoles within guard cells fuse together to form much larger vacuoles, causing the guard cells to swell and cover the stomatal aperture. (write something about how fusion is critical to the functioning of vacuoles) 
|     In contrast to their simplistic internal structure, the process of vacuole fusion is remarkably complex. Consequently, researchers have turned to the study of model organisms in an attempt to better understand the components and signaling mechanisms involved in vacuole fusion. _S. Cerevisiae_, also known as brewers yeast, has proven to be an ideal candidate for studying vacuole fusion (specifically homotypic vacuole fusion) due to its extensively studied genome, easy to visualize vacuoles, and our ability to isolate, purify, and store its vacuoles in high quantities. Furthermore, nearly 50 years of extensive research has been devoted to the study of yeast vacuole fusion providing researchers with a strong foundation of research to draw from.
