	abstract = {Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors ({SNAREs}) are a family of small conserved eukaryotic proteins that mediate membrane fusion between organelles and with the plasma membrane. {SNAREs} are directly or indirectly anchored to membranes. Prior to fusion, complementary {SNAREs} assemble between membranes with the aid of accessory proteins that provide a scaffold to initiate {SNARE} zippering, pulling the membranes together and mediating fusion. Recent advances have enabled the construction of detailed models describing bilayer transitions and energy barriers along the fusion pathway and have elucidated the structures of {SNAREs} complexed in various states with regulatory proteins. In this Review, we discuss how these advances are yielding an increasingly detailed picture of the {SNARE}-mediated fusion pathway, leading from first contact between the membranes via metastable non-bilayer intermediates towards the opening and expansion of a fusion pore. We describe how {SNARE} proteins assemble into complexes, how this assembly is regulated by accessory proteins and how {SNARE} complexes overcome the free energy barriers that prevent spontaneous membrane fusion.},

We report a new mutant allele of \textit{{VTI}11} that implicates the {SNARE} protein {VTI}11 in homotypic fusion of protein storage and lytic vacuoles. Fusion of the multiple vacuoles present in \textit{vti11} mutants could be induced by treatment with Wortmannin and {LY}294002, which are inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase ({PI}3K). We provide evidence that Phosphatidylinositol 3-Phosphate ({PtdIns}(3)P) regulates vacuole fusion in \textit{vti11} mutants, and that fusion of these vacuoles requires intact microtubules and actin filaments. Finally, we show that Wortmannin also induced the fusion of guard cell vacuoles in fava beans, where vacuoles are naturally fragmented after {ABA}-induced stomata closure. These results suggest a ubiquitous role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion, both during the development of the large central vacuole and during the dynamic vacuole remodeling that occurs as part of stomata movements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Soluble Vam7p is specifically recruited to vacuoles and can rescue a fusion reaction poisoned with antibodies to Vam7p. Both the recombinant Vam7p {PX} domain and a {FYVE} domain construct of human Hrs block the recruitment of Vam7p and vacuole fusion, demonstrating that phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is a primary receptor of Vam7p on vacuoles. We propose that the Vam7p cycle is linked to the availability of a lipid domain on yeast vacuoles, which is essential for coordinating the fusion reaction prior to and beyond docking.},

Current reconstitutions have yet to faithfully replicate the fusion process in at least three respects: 1) The density of {SNARE} proteins required for fusion in vitro is substantially higher than on the organelle. 2) Substantial lysis accompanies reconstituted fusion. 3) The Rab {GTPase} Ypt7 is essential in vivo but often dispensable in vitro. Here we report that changes in fatty acyl chain composition dramatically lower the density of {SNAREs} that are required for fusion. By providing more physiological lipids with a lower phase transition temperature, we achieved efficient fusion with {SNARE} concentrations as low as on the native organelle. Although fused proteoliposomes became unstable at elevated {SNARE} concentrations, releasing their content after fusion had occurred, reconstituted proteoliposomes with substantially reduced {SNARE} concentrations fused without concomitant lysis. The Rab {GTPase} Ypt7 is essential on both membranes for proteoliposome fusion to occur at these {SNARE} concentrations. Strikingly, it was only critical for Ypt7 to be {GTP} loaded on membranes bearing the R-{SNARE} Nyv1, whereas the bound nucleotide of Ypt7 was irrelevant on membranes bearing the Q-{SNAREs} Vam3 and Vti1.},

Adding a transmembrane anchor to the N-terminus of Sec17 bypasses this requirement for apolarity of the Sec17 loop, suggesting that the loop functions for membrane binding rather than to trigger bilayer rearrangement. In contrast, when complete C-terminal {SNARE} zippering is prevented, fusion strictly requires Sec18 and Sec17, and the Sec17 apolar loop has functions beyond membrane anchoring. Thus Sec17 and Sec18 act twice in the fusion cycle, binding to trans-{SNARE} complexes to accelerate fusion, then hydrolyzing {ATP} to disassemble cis-{SNARE} complexes.},

Previously, we demonstrated that Sec17 and Sec18 can bypass the requirement of complete zippering for fusion (Song et al., 2021), but it has been unclear whether this activity of Sec17 and Sec18 is directly coupled to {HOPS}. {HOPS} can be replaced for fusion by a synthetic tether when the three Q-{SNAREs} are pre-assembled. We now report that fusion intermediates with arrested {SNARE} zippering, formed with a synthetic tether but without {HOPS}, support Sec17/Sec18-triggered fusion. This zippering-bypass fusion is thus a direct result of Sec17 and Sec18 interactions: with each other, with the platform of partially zippered {SNAREs}, and with the apposed tethered membranes. As these fusion elements are shared among all exocytic and endocytic traffic, Sec17 and Sec18 may have a general role in directly promoting fusion.},

These include ergosterol biosynthesis, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate turnover, and signaling from Rho {GTPases} to actin remodeling. These pathways are supported by the sensitivity of the late stages of vacuole fusion to inhibitors of phospholipase C, calcium channels, and actin remodeling. Using databases of yeast protein interactions, we found that many nonessential genes identified in our deletion screen interact with essential genes that are directly involved in vacuole fusion.

	abstract = {The fundamental processes of membrane fission and fusion determine size and copy numbers of intracellular organelles. While {SNARE} proteins and tethering complexes mediate intracellular membrane fusion, fission requires the presence of dynamin or dynamin-related proteins. Here we study these reactions in native yeast vacuoles and find that the yeast dynamin homolog Vps1 is not only an essential part of the fission machinery, but also controls membrane fusion by generating an active Qa {SNARE}- tethering complex pool, which is essential for trans-{SNARE} formation. Our findings provide new insight into the role of dynamins in membrane fusion by directly acting on {SNARE} proteins.},

	abstract = {The conserved catalysts of intracellular membrane fusion are Rab-family {GTPases}, effector complexes that bind Rabs for membrane tethering, {SNARE} proteins of the R, Qa, Qb, and Qc families, and {SNARE} chaperones of the {SM}, Sec17/{SNAP}, and Sec18/{NSF} families. Yeast vacuole fusion is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate ({PI}3P). {PI}3P binds directly to the vacuolar Qc-{SNARE} and to {HOPS}, the vacuolar tethering/{SM} complex. We now report several distinct functions of {PI}3P in fusion. {PI}3P binds the N-terminal {PX} domain of the Qc-{SNARE} to enhance its engagement for fusion. Even when Qc has been preassembled with the Qa- and Qb-{SNAREs}, {PI}3P still promotes trans-{SNARE} assembly and fusion between these 3Q proteoliposomes and those with R-{SNARE}, whether with the natural {HOPS} tether or with a synthetic tether. With {HOPS}, efficient trans-{SNARE} complex formation needs {PI}3P on the 3Q-{SNARE} proteoliposomes, in cis to the Qc. {PI}3P is also needed for {HOPS} to confer resistance to Sec17/Sec18. With a synthetic tether, fusion is supported by {PI}3P on either fusion partner membrane, but this fusion is blocked by Sec17/Sec18. {PI}3P thus supports multiple stages of fusion: the engagement of the Qc-{SNARE}, trans-{SNARE} complex formation with preassembled Q-{SNAREs}, {HOPS} protection of {SNARE} complexes from Sec17/Sec18, and fusion per se after tethering and Q-{SNARE} assembly.},

Furthermore, modifying endogenous {PI}(3,4,5)P3 with the phosphatase {PTEN} also blocked fusion. Fluorescence microscopy showed that {PI}(3,4,5)P3 was enriched at membrane vertex microdomains, which was blocked by {PTEN}, C8-{PI}(3,4,5)P3, and the class {III} {PI} 3-kinase inhibitor {SAR}405. Importantly, blocking or eliminating {PI}(3,4,5)P3 prevented the vertex enrichment of Ypt7 and the {HOPS} subunit Vps33. Finally, we show that the soluble {SNARE} Vam7 binds {PI}(3,4,5)P3 and that {PTEN} abolished trans-{SNARE} pairing between partner vesicles.

	abstract = {Lysosomes are of central importance in cellular recycling, nutrient signaling 1,2 and endocytosis, and are tightly connected to autophagy 3 and the invasion of pathogenic bacteria and viruses 1,4. Lysosomal fusion events are fundamental to cell survival and require {HOPS}, a conserved heterohexameric tethering complex 5,6. {HOPS} recognizes and binds small membrane-associated {GTPases} on lysosomes and organelles, and assembles membrane bound {SNAREs} for fusion 7,8. Through tethering, {HOPS} brings membranes in close proximity to each other and significantly increases fusion efficacy by catalysing {SNARE} assembly. Consequently, different {HOPS} mutations are causative for severe diseases 6. Despite its fundamental cellular duties, it remained speculative how {HOPS} fulfils its function as high-resolution structural data were unavailable. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of {HOPS}. In the complex, two central subunits form the backbone and an assembly hub for the functional domains. Two {GTPase} binding units extend to opposing ends, while the {SNARE} binding module points to the side, resulting in a triangular shape of the complex. Unlike previously reported, {HOPS} is surprisingly rigid and extensive flexibility is confined to its extremities. We show that {HOPS} complex variants with mutations proximal to the backbone can still tether membranes but fail to efficiently promote fusion indicating, that the observed integrity of {HOPS} is essential to its function. In our model, the core of {HOPS} acts as a counter bearing between the flexible {GTPase} binding domains. This positions the {SNARE} binding module exactly between the {GTPase} anchored membranes to promote fusion. Our structural and functional analysis reveals the link between the spectacular architecture of {HOPS} and its mechanism that couples membrane tethering and {SNARE} assembly, to catalyse lysosomal fusion.},

We show that homotypic fusion and protein sorting ({HOPS}) binds Vam7 via its subunits Vps16 and Vps18. In addition, we observed that Vps16, Vps18, and the Sec1/Munc18 protein Vps33, which is also part of the {HOPS} complex, bind to the Q-{SNARE} complex. In agreement with this observation, {HOPS}-stimulated fusion was inhibited if {HOPS} was preincubated with the minimal Q-{SNARE} complex. Importantly, artificial targeting of Vam7 without its {PX} domain to membranes rescued vacuole morphology in vivo, but resulted in a cytokinesis defect if the N-terminal domain of Vam3 was also removed. Our data thus support a model of {HOPS}-controlled membrane fusion by recognizing different elements of the {SNARE} complex.},

This leads to trans-{SNARE} pairing, i.e. formation of {SNARE} complexes between apposed membranes. The yeast vacuole system has revealed two subsequent molecular events: trans-complex formation of V-{ATPase} proteolipid sectors (V(0)) and release of {LMA}1 from the membrane. We have now identified a hetero-oligomeric membrane integral complex of vacuolar transporter chaperone (Vtc) proteins integrating these events. The Vtc complex associates with the R-{SNARE} Nyv1p and with V(0). Subunits Vtc1p and Vtc4p control the initial steps of fusion. They are required for Sec18p/{NSF} activity in {SNARE} priming, membrane binding of {LMA}1 and V(0) trans-complex formation. In contrast, subunit Vtc3p is required for the latest step, {LMA}1 release, but dispensible for all preceding steps, including V(0) trans-complex formation. This suggests that Vtc3p might act close to or at fusion pore opening. We propose that Vtc proteins may couple {ATP}-dependent {NSF} activity to a subset of V(0) sectors in order to activate them for V(0) trans-complex formation and/or control fusion pore opening.},

	abstract = {Background
The rapid growth of protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) data has led to the emergence of {PPI} network analysis. Despite advances in high-throughput techniques, the interactomes of several model organisms are still far from complete. Therefore, it is desirable to expand these interactomes with ortholog-based and other methods.

Results
Orthologous pairs of 18 eukaryotic species were expanded and merged with experimental {PPI} datasets. The contributions of interologs from each species were evaluated. The expanded orthologous pairs enable the inference of interologs for various species. For example, more than 32,000 human interactions can be predicted. The same dataset has also been applied to the prediction of host-pathogen interactions. {PPIs} between P. falciparum calmodulin and several H. sapiens proteins are predicted, and these interactions may contribute to the maintenance of host cell Ca2+ concentration. Using comparisons with Bayesian and structure-based approaches, interactions between putative {HSP}40 homologs of P. falciparum and the H. sapiens {TNF} receptor associated factor family are revealed, suggesting a role for these interactions in the interference of the human immune response to P. falciparum.

Conclusion
The {PPI} datasets are available from {POINT}  and {POINeT} . Further development of methods to predict host-pathogen interactions should incorporate multiple approaches in order to improve sensitivity, and should facilitate the identification of targets for drug discovery and design.},

Defects in catalysts of each stage result in fragmented (unfused) vacuoles. Strains with deletions in any of {ERG} genes 3–6, lacking normal ergosterol biosynthesis, have fragmented vacuoles. The ergosterol ligands filipin, nystatin and amphotericin B block the in vitro fusion of vacuoles from wild‐type cells. Each of these inhibitors acts at the priming stage to inhibit Sec17p release from vacuoles. A reversible delay in Sec18p action prevents vacuoles from acquiring resistance to any of these three drugs, confirming that their action is on the normal fusion pathway. Ergosterol or cholesterol delivery to wild‐type vacuoles stimulates their in vitro fusion, and the in vitro fusion of {ergΔ} vacuoles requires added sterol.

We now report that vacuolar v- and t-{SNAREs} are mainly found with Sec17p as v–t-{SNARE} complexes in vivo and on purified vacuoles rather than only transiently forming such complexes during docking, and disrupting them upon fusion. In the priming reaction, Sec18p and {ATP} dissociate this v–t-{SNARE} complex, accompanied by the release of Sec17p. {SNARE} complex structure governs each functional aspect of priming, as the v-{SNARE} regulates the rate of Sec17p release and, in turn, Sec17p-dependent {SNARE} complex disassembly is required for independent function of the two {SNAREs}. Sec17p physically and functionally interacts largely with the t-{SNARE}. (a) Antibodies to the t-{SNARE}, but not the v-{SNARE}, block Sec17p release. (b) Sec17p is associated with the t-{SNARE} in the absence of v-{SNARE}, but is not bound to the v-{SNARE} without t-{SNARE}. (c) Vacuoles with t-{SNARE} but no v-{SNARE} still require Sec17p/Sec18p priming, whereas their fusion partners with v-{SNARE} but no t-{SNARE} do not. Sec18p thus acts, upon {ATP} hydrolysis, to disassemble the v–t-{SNARE} complex, prime the t-{SNARE}, and release the Sec17p to allow {SNARE} participation in docking and fusion. These studies suggest that the analogous {ATP}-dependent disassembly of the 20-S complex of {NSF}, α-{SNAP}, and v- and t-{SNAREs}, which has been studied in detergent extracts, corresponds to the priming of {SNAREs} for docking rather than to the fusion of docked membranes.},

	abstract = {Yeast vacuoles undergo priming, docking, and homotypic fusion, although little has been known of the connections between these reactions. Vacuole-associated Vam2p and Vam6p (Vam2/6p) are components of a 65S complex containing {SNARE} proteins. Upon priming by Sec18p/{NSF} and {ATP}, Vam2/6p is released as a 38S subcomplex that binds Ypt7p to initiate docking. We now report that the 38S complex consists of both Vam2/6p and the class C Vps proteins [Reider, S. E. and Emr, S. D. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell 8, 2307–2327]. This complex includes Vps33p, a member of the Sec1 family of proteins that bind t-{SNAREs}. We term this 38S complex {HOPS}, for homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting. This unexpected finding explains how Vam2/6p associates with {SNAREs} and provides a mechanistic link of the class C Vps proteins to Ypt/Rab action. {HOPS} initially associates with vacuole {SNAREs} in “cis” and, after release by priming, hops to Ypt7p, activating this Ypt/Rab switch to initiate docking.},

	abstract = {The V-{ATPase} is a proton pump consisting of a membrane-integral V0 sector and a peripheral V1 sector, which carries the {ATPase} activity. In vitro studies of yeast vacuole fusion and evidence from worms, flies, zebrafish and mice suggested that V0 interacts with the {SNARE} machinery for membrane fusion, that it promotes the induction of hemifusion and that this activity requires physical presence of V0 rather than its proton pump activity. A recent in vivo study in yeast has challenged these interpretations, concluding that fusion required solely lumenal acidification but not the V0 sector itself. Here, we identify the reasons for this discrepancy and reconcile it. We find that acute pharmacological or physiological inhibition of V-{ATPase} pump activity de-acidifies the vacuole lumen in living yeast cells within minutes. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that de-acidification induces vacuole fusion rather than inhibiting it. Cells expressing mutated V0 subunits that maintain vacuolar acidity were blocked in this fusion. Thus, proton pump activity of the V-{ATPase} negatively regulates vacuole fusion in vivo. Vacuole fusion in vivo does, however, require physical presence of a fusion-competent V0 sector.},

The V-{ATPase} is a multi-subunit, rotary proton pump whose precise role in homotypic fusion is controversial. Models formulated from in vitro studies suggest that it is the proteolipid proton-translocating pore of the V-{ATPase} that functions in fusion, with further studies in worms, flies, zebrafish, and mice appearing to support this model. We present two in vivo assays and use a mutant V-{ATPase} subunit to establish that it is the H+-translocation/vacuole acidification function, rather than the physical presence of the {VATPase} that promotes homotypic vacuole fusion in yeast. Furthermore, we show that acidification of the yeast vacuole in the absence of the V-{ATPase} rescues vacuole fusion defects. Our results clarify the in vivo requirements of acidification for membrane fusion.},

We find that a large multisubunit protein called the Vam2/6p complex is bound to cis-paired {SNAP} receptors ({SNAREs}) on isolated vacuoles. This association of the Vam2/6p complex with the cis-{SNARE} complex is disrupted during priming. The Vam2/6p complex then binds to Ypt7p, a guanosine triphosphate binding protein of the Rab family, to initiate productive contact between vacuoles. Thus, cis-{SNARE} complexes can contain Rab/Ypt effectors, and these effectors can be mobilized by {NSF}/Sec18p-driven priming, allowing their direct association with a Rab/Ypt protein to activate docking.},

This inheritance reaction can be studied in vitro with isolated vacuoles. Rapid and efficient homotypic fusion between saltwashed vacuoles requires the addition of only two purified soluble proteins, Sec18p ({NSF}) and {LMA}1, a novel heterodimer with a thioredoxin subunit. We now report the identity of the second subunit of {LMA}1 as {IB}
2, a previously identified cytosolic inhibitor of vacuolar proteinase B. Both subunits are needed for efficient vacuole inheritance in vivo and for the {LMA}1 activity in cell extracts. Each subunit acts via a novel mechanism, as the thioredoxin subunit is not acting through redox chemistry and {LMA}1 is still needed for the fusion of vacuoles which do not contain proteinase B. Both Sec18p and {LMA}1 act at an early stage of the in vitro reaction. Though {LMA}1 does not stimulate Sec18p-mediated Sec17p release, {LMA}1 cannot fulfill its function before Sec18p. Upon Sec17p/Sec18p action, vacuoles become labile but are rapidly stabilized by {LMA}1. The action of {LMA}1 and Sec18p is thus coupled and ordered. These data establish {LMA}1 as a novel factor in trafficking of yeast vacuoles.},

Although the protein catalysts of membrane fusion are well characterized, their response to their surrounding microenvironment, provided by the lipid composition of the membrane, remains to be fully understood. Membranes are composed of bulk lipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine), as well as regulatory lipids that undergo constant modifications by kinases, phosphatases, and lipases. These lipids include phosphoinositides, diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and cholesterol/ergosterol. Here we describe the roles of these lipids throughout the stages of yeast vacuole homotypic fusion.},

Analysis of homotypic vacuole fusion demonstrated that vacuoles from strains defective in the {CCZ}1 and {MON}1 genes could not fuse. Morphological evidence suggested that these mutant vacuoles could not proceed to the tethering/docking stage. Ccz1 and Mon1 form a stable protein complex that binds the vacuole membrane. In the absence of the Ccz1–Mon1 complex, the integrity of vacuole {SNARE} pairing and the unpaired {SNARE} class C Vps/{HOPS} complex interaction were both impaired. The Ccz1–Mon1 complex colocalized with other fusion components on the vacuole as part of the cis-{SNARE} complex, and the association of the Ccz1–Mon1 complex with the vacuole appeared to be regulated by the class C Vps/{HOPS} complex proteins. Accordingly, we propose that the Ccz1–Mon1 complex is critical for the Ypt7-dependent tethering/docking stage leading to the formation of a trans-{SNARE} complex and subsequent vacuole fusion.},

Here we examined the relationship between membrane fusion and {PA} phosphatase activity. Pah1p is the single yeast homologue of the Lipin family of {PA} phosphatases. Deletion of {PAH}1 was sufficient to cause marked vacuole fragmentation and abolish vacuole fusion. The function of Pah1p solely depended on its phosphatase activity as complementation studies showed that wild type Pah1p restored fusion, whereas the phosphatase dead mutant Pah1pD398E had no effect. We discovered that the lack of {PA} phosphatase activity blocked fusion by inhibiting the binding of {SNAREs} to Sec18p, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor homologue responsible for priming inactive cis-{SNARE} complexes. In addition, pah1Δ vacuoles were devoid of the late endosome/vacuolar Rab Ypt7p, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34p, and Vps39p, a subunit of the {HOPS} (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) tethering complex, all of which are required for vacuole fusion. The lack of Vps34p resulted in the absence of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, a lipid required for {SNARE} activity and vacuole fusion. These findings demonstrate that Pah1p and {PA} phosphatase activity are critical for vacuole homeostasis and fusion.},
